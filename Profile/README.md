# BSc (Hons) Computing-23.2 - PDSA Project

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the **BSc (Hons) Computing-23.2 PDSA project**. This platform is dedicated to the development and collaboration of a unique gaming suite that serves as both an educational tool and a source of entertainment.

## Project Overview

This project encompasses the development of a comprehensive gaming platform as part of the coursework for the **PDSA module**. The platform will feature **five distinct games**, each with its own set of challenges and learning outcomes. The games include:

1. **Eight Queens' Puzzle**: Enhance your problem-solving skills by tackling this classic challenge.
2. **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Test your strategy against an AI opponent.
3. **Identify Shortest Path**: Apply graph algorithms to find the most efficient routes.
4. **Remember the Value Index**: Sharpen your memory with this number placement challenge.
5. **Predict the Value Index**: Use search algorithms to predict number positions.

Each game is designed to test and improve the players' problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Learning Outcomes

Through engaging with these games, players will:

- Understand and apply various algorithms and data structures.
- Estimate solutions to complex problems.
- Improve strategic thinking and memory retention.

Certainly! I apologize for the oversight. Let's provide more detailed contribution guidelines for your **BSc (Hons) Computing-23.2 PDSA Project**:
